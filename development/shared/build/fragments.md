# Family fragments

## Runtime helper policy

`rules.optout` expands `runtime/skill_optout.md` for Code and UI. Other Skills
retain their narrower wording. `rules.python` expands the interpreter discovery
rule from `runtime/python_discovery.md` for Ask, Setup, Code, Plan, Workflow,
Handoff, UI and Project Context Cleanup. File reading is defined in the shared
writing rules; agents choose their permitted method.
`rules.native_output` expands `runtime/native_output.md` inside the conditional Codex shell reference. `rules.python` links to `references/shell-commands.md` relative to SKILL.md; include it only in Skill entrypoints. Raw fragments contain no profile blocks. Use these include
keys only for the stated consumers. Receipts hash the consumed canonical files;
snapshots and exports retain them. These rules do not belong in `family.contract`,
which applies to every suite member.

Register every packaged Python file under `helper_contracts`, keyed by its
Skill-relative `scripts/<name>.py` path. Use `kind: helper` for executable
entrypoints and `kind: library` for imported support code. General helpers also
declare `fallback: references/fallbacks/<name>-fallback.md`; libraries do not.
List each fallback file in the manifest with `profiles: ["general"]`.

Put `{{ include: helper.policy }}` once in the Skill entrypoint. The builder
generates helper-first routing and the conditional reference table. Each manual
file begins with `<!-- helper-fallback: scripts/<name>.py -->`, followed by its
complete no-Python procedure. Do not inline or separately link these optional
routes. Codex strips fallback metadata and rejects fallback files and links.
Package building and verification check the exact registry and route structure.
Behavioral equivalence and diagnostic quality still require consumer tests.

## Portable suite sources

The workspace sibling `shared/` is the authoring source. Before release run
`python ../shared/build/sync_suite_sources.py --root .` from each suite, then
repeat with `--check`. This copies shared build/runtime sources and their tests under
`development/shared/`, with file hashes in `sources.json`. Unexpected files
block synchronization rather than being deleted.

The suite entrypoint uses the sibling builder in the authoring workspace and
the bundled builder in an isolated clone. Shared paths resolve beside that
builder, never against an unrelated installed Skill. Runtime dependencies are
still copied into each Skill package. The development snapshot is not installed.

Both suite repositories retain their member/template sources and development
files. Release assembly also places every installable Skill under `packages/`.
Individual distribution repositories contain only their package and user-facing
root files. Workflow has no separate distribution repository.

Suite-specific tests run from `development/tests`. Shared tests use `shared/` and `scoville-suite/` as siblings, covering both build profiles and the standalone Codex Ask package. The bundled copy retains those test sources
for development, but installing a Skill requires none of them.
`build/run_portability.py` runs those complete tests in authoring sources. In an
export it validates only the selected manifest, fixed layout and exact packages;
it never asks a projected tree to recreate an excluded profile.

Members default to `distribution: standalone`. `distribution: suite` targets
the suite repository and stages its package at `<suite>/packages/<member>`.
The receipt records `distribution` and `package_path`. Publication and tests
must use that path, not assume `<member>` at the staging root. Visibility gates
apply equally to both kinds. A suite-only member has no standalone repository.

README manifests accept `shared:filename.md` for templates owned by
`shared/readme/`. Other paths stay suite-relative. Shared templates use the same
`{{ var: key }}` and `{{ include: key }}` expansion as local fragments. Missing
files/variables and paths escaping the template directory fail the build.
Exported READMEs contain expanded text, not references to this source directory.
Build receipts record each consumed member README template's SHA-256.

Package `files` entries also accept `shared:<relative-path>`, rooted at the
canonical shared directory. Existing `shared_helpers` entries use the same
resolver and retain their scripts-only destination constraint. Snapshots and
receipts include consumed shared files. Installed packages never import them
from another Skill or a development checkout.

For suite-only README sections use
`{"source": "shared:member-development.md", "audience": "suite"}` in the
member's `readme` list. Strings apply to both targets. Member previews render
the suite target. Packages always render the release target, including private
Workflow builds. Unknown audience values fail instead of silently dropping text.

Each member's `development` object defines suite-relative `source`, `tests` and
`notes` paths. Targets must exist. The suite `repository` supplies the final
GitHub URL. `member.development` renders compact links inside the suite-only
block. `suite.development` renders all members in the suite README, including
Ask variants without creating member previews. Use the shared templates for both.

Keep current development links in that block, not in release prose. Builds
reject unresolved local Markdown file links and development files. Relative
links resolve against the generated package, never the source checkout.
Code examples and historical CHANGELOG links are excluded from the link check.
External URLs and heading anchors need separate release checks. Historical
evidence stays explicit, never automatically rewritten to an imported commit.

`suite.json` owns membership. Scoville members also define `family.order`
(unique nonnegative integer), `label`, `owner`, and `summary`. Add a member once;
full lists follow its order. Ask uses manifest member order.

Use `{{ include: KEY }}` in exported Markdown or README source fragments:

| KEY | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `suite.members` | Member preview links, or public repository links when `member_previews:false` |
| `suite.descriptions` | Suite README only: each member's first README fragment, with `featured_member` first, then family order |
| `family.owners` | Public members and their ownership |
| `family.links` | Public family links; private member READMEs also include private members |
| `family.install` | Only approved public installation URLs |
| `family.neighbors` | Current member's explicit `family.neighbors` subset |

Neighbor entries use `member` for a suite member or `external` for another
Skill, plus `description` and optional `optional: true`. Preserve specialized
scope and authored order; adding a family member never expands a subset.
An existing optional private neighbor reference is not publication approval.
Historical evidence and ordinary prose references are not membership lists.

The first four member README fragments form `description_fragments`: title and
introduction, How it works, What it enforces, What it costs. The last three use
bullets. Suite descriptions reuse the complete block and demote headings outside
code fences. Keep absolute links and no include tags inside these fragments.
Follow [the common project template](../readme/README-template.md) for all projects.
How it was developed uses brief prose and stays outside the suite description block.

The shared builder expands placeholders before packaging. Packages contain
complete Markdown and need no shared directory. Never install source templates.
Unknown fragments, unknown internal neighbors and invalid order fail the build.

With `member_previews:false`, `--write-readmes` updates only the suite README;
`--check-sources` validates payloads without creating member copies. Other suites
retain previews by default. Regenerate them with `--write-readmes` and check with
`--check-readmes`.
After building, run `--check-packages --output <build-directory>` to detect
edited or stale package content against current sources. Receipt hashes alone
detect changed output, not a stale source projection.

For a shared output containing several suites, use
`python verify_package_set.py --root <output> --receipt <receipt-a> --receipt <receipt-b>`.
This read-only check requires the exact combined file/directory inventory and
SHA-256 values. Keep each original receipt; never overwrite one with another.
It does not prove source freshness, model-test success or release authority.

## Distribution profiles

Scoville uses `--profile general` (default) or `--profile codex`. `suite.json`
contains two flat profile objects with name, repository and optional README
sources. Member and file entries may declare `profiles: ["general"]` or
`profiles: ["codex"]`; omission selects both. The resolved manifest owns every
projection. Optional neighbors and the featured member disappear when excluded.
Unknown profiles fail. Visibility checks still apply to the selected members.

Keep short text alternatives beside their owner using flat blocks:
`{{ profile: general }}portable text{{ /profile }}` and
`{{ profile: codex }}required-helper text{{ /profile }}`. Empty alternatives may
be omitted. Unknown or incomplete blocks and nesting within the same block kind
fail. A profile block inside a package block is supported: profile selection
runs before package selection. No expression language or runtime conditionals
are supported. Built packages contain plain text.

Default README previews remain in the source tree. Other profile previews
require `--write-readmes --profile codex --output <new-preview-directory>`.
Package verification selects the profile recorded in its build receipt.

`export_suite.py --profile <profile>` requires inspected committed sources and
a current shared snapshot. It replaces tracked generated packages, filters
excluded members and file sources, and writes an effective `suite.json` plus
matching README previews. Runtime source profile blocks are resolved; shared
build tools remain unchanged. The exported tree rebuilds its selected profile
without the authoring workspace. Export never grants publication authority.

## Installation layout

`--layout standalone` builds independent general Skills with family guidance.
`--layout suite` builds every selected-profile member inside its suite's own
`packages/` tree. Codex defaults to suite layout. `standalone_profiles: ["codex"]` permits the Ask standalone projection; other Codex members remain suite-only. `catalog_profiles` lists editions whose README advertises an excluded member without bundling its sources. `availability` supplies its host label; `suite.catalog` renders that installation catalog. A suite build rejects member subsets and
unapproved public members; it never silently produces a partial suite.
Exports always retain `layout: suite` and rebuild only that edition/layout.

`{{ package: standalone }}...{{ /package }}` and
`{{ package: suite }}...{{ /package }}` select installation-contract prose.
These flat blocks are independent of the general/codex Python profile.
`family.contract` expands canonical `runtime/skill_composition.md`;
other family projections are absent from suite packages. README requirements
come from `readme/skill-installation-contract.md` and
`readme/suite-requirements.md`. Suite installation uses only its own packages;
missing members are errors, never permission to fetch individual repositories.

Local release staging uses exactly `<workspace-root>/skills/temp/release`.
Do not keep dated/numbered candidate builds in the regular Skill directories.
Synchronize every generated Skill distribution from this verified build,
including the fixed public suite targets. Remove obsolete generated files;
preserve source repositories and Git history. Regular Skill directories contain
only their current verified output, never build candidates or stale copies.

## Runtime build gate

Builds containing Python runtime helpers reuse a successful private GitHub
Actions matrix when packaged Python and Python CI tests are unchanged. Changes
to instructions, documentation, configuration or build tools need appropriate
local checks, not a new matrix. Current package integrity remains required. The matrix
runs Windows, macOS and Linux on Python 3.11 and the current stable Python.
It exercises packaged helpers and their actual local consumers; no live
adviser calls or credentials are needed. The private CI repository is
`benjaminstelzer/scoville-runtime-ci`. Never push private sources to public CI.

For changed packaged Python or Python CI tests:

1. Prepare the test snapshot under the sole release staging tree:

   ```text
   python development/build_suite.py --prepare-runtime-ci <release/runtime-ci>
   ```

2. Commit and push this generated snapshot to the private CI repository.
3. Wait for all six `Runtime helpers` jobs.

   Use `--refresh` only after existing readers finish and while inventory is
   unchanged; it preserves `.git` and refuses edited staging files. Do not maintain
   snapshot copies separately from canonical sources.

4. Pass the successful run URL to the normal build:

   ```text
   python development/build_suite.py --profile codex --layout suite --public-only --output <package-build> --runtime-run https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-runtime-ci/actions/runs/ID
   ```

The builder verifies GitHub run/job status, tested commit, packaged Python and
Python CI test bytes. Non-Python differences reuse that proof; local checks
cover their effects and bind the current complete package and helper registry.
Changed Python requires a new run. Missing, failed, skipped or stale Python
evidence blocks the build. Authenticated `gh` access to private CI is required.
`--check-publication --output <package-build>` verifies the current clean source,
shared snapshot, exact package receipt and runtime run before a Skill push.
The Python `build()` function remains a local candidate constructor for tests;
its receipt says `runtime_validation.status: pending`, never runtime acceptance.

## Independent Plan Viewer

The application source, native Actions builds and release gate belong to
`benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan-viewer`, maintained locally under
`projects/scoville-plan-viewer`. Follow its `development/README.md` and
`scripts/verify_release.py` when publishing applications or installers.

Skill publication and installation need no Viewer build or GitHub Release.
Publish every changed verified Skill target by branch push. Keep Viewer binaries
out of Git and installable Skill packages. Download links point only to the
application repository. Preserve existing downloads until a replacement passes
the application's provenance, inventory and upload checks.
