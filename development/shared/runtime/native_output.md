Apply the shared reading rule before native delivery. Process machine data in
code, whether returned directly or as a capture file. Display its checked result,
not the capture. Use the template below only for output already selected under
that rule; forward rendered checker output unchanged as text.
Do not JSON-encode it again or add unchecked status lines. Structured helper
results and native tool arguments keep their own interfaces.

Keep the complete `exec_command` result until the command ends, including
`session_id`, every output chunk and the final exit status. A completed outer script does not prove child completion. Use the
template below for captures, one per outer call.

This template selects 20000;
use the same smallest applicable limit in the generated command, both tools and
outer directive. Before execution, replace `<command_json>` with one JSON string
literal encoding the complete generated command, including quotes and backslashes.
Replace the whole value; never paste a command inside existing quotes or a
JavaScript template literal. JSON encoding preserves backticks and `${` as data.

```javascript
// @exec: {"max_output_tokens": 20000}
let r = await tools.exec_command({
  cmd: <command_json>,
  max_output_tokens: 20000
});
let output = r.output;
while (r.session_id !== undefined) {
  r = await tools.write_stdin({
    session_id: r.session_id, chars: "", yield_time_ms: 10000,
    max_output_tokens: 20000
  });
  output += r.output;
}
text(output);
```

Check completeness separately from command success:

| Result | Completion condition |
| --- | --- |
| Running `session_id` | Retain its ID and every chunk until completion; never restart the command. |
| `exit=` from `--run` | Both streams are captured; the child exit status determines command success. A nonzero exit can supply valid failure evidence. |
| Complete-file metadata | Use the complete-file distinction above and process the supplied file under the shared reading rule: machine data in code, required prose in full. |
| Empty output, capture failure, or missing output without a complete-file route | Required input remains unread; stop dependent work. |

Never discard a failure's stdout or stderr.
