description: Maintain, resume and audit repository Plans, Work Items and Decisions for Scoville Plan requests, existing planning profiles with PROJECT_INDEX.md and docs/plans, or explicitly requested durable planning across interruptions. Handle changes to active Plan work; exclude informational questions without retained action, small tasks needing no durable Plan, explicit opt-out, and requested transfer prompts, which belong to Handoff.
compatibility: "Codex with repository read and write access and Python 3.11+. Direct Markdown and YAML planning needs no service or network. Bundled selector and validator are required for their operations. Missing dependencies or helper errors block the affected operation."

# Scoville Plan

Maintain native `format_version: 1` Plans, Work Items and Decisions through
direct Markdown and YAML edits to the repository's existing planning records.
A small reversible task needs no new Plan unless the repository requires one.

If the user explicitly opts out, use neither this Skill nor its references or
records, and report a repository rule that requires them.

{{ include: family.contract }}

{{ include: family.neighbors }}

Plan alone decides the wording of its records and their lifecycle (creation, status changes, deletion); it does not start execution
or choose dispatch routes. One editor changes the records at a time. Meanwhile
nobody changes the affected files or the required model and reasoning
settings: the files carry no lock, and a concurrent change is lost silently.
Reads and Skill upgrades need no migration.

For requested PROJECT_INDEX.md prose additions or cleanup, apply Scoville
Project Context Cleanup within the same prepared edit; Plan keeps the fields
and lifecycle.

## Authority and evidence

1. Explicit user instructions and repository rules take precedence over this
   Skill. Your temporary task list is a throwaway copy; the records count.
2. Preserve scope (Goal, Non-goals, Outcome), choices (accepted Decisions and the user's explicit choices), dependencies (`Depends on`) and binding constraints (Acceptance, Instructions, repository rules). Source material, silence, current behavior or structural validity (a passing validator or manual inspection) proves neither permission nor performed work.
   A recorded stop covers only the scope it records, not later or neighboring
   work.
3. Ask only for a missing material choice: activation, cancellation,
   deletion, changed scope, changed Acceptance requirements, an ambiguous
   successor or a Decision transition, and only where the applicable accepted
   Decisions and the current item's Instructions leave it open. Appending
   newly requested work as a todo Work Item does not wait for such a choice;
   authoring.md has the rule. After an interruption or compaction, recover
   and continue under progress.md. Repeat a question or status report only
   after a material change, on request or where a rule requires it.
4. Before creating a Decision, search existing Decision titles and scopes for
   the same choice. Read plausible matches completely and reuse one that
   already governs it, so that one choice has one record. Keep temporary
   sequencing or execution direction in Instructions unless it changes a
   material choice or a permission. Record an explicit material human choice as an accepted Decision, an unresolved one as a proposal: report
   its alternatives, tradeoffs and effect and ask before the work that
   depends on it; only that work waits. Link a Decision where it governs the
   item's Outcome, Steps, Acceptance, Instructions, required checks or
   permissions, not for background or shared history. After a Work Item has
   started, add each relevant proposal to its Decisions field; relevant
   accepted Decisions may be added too. Read a Decision's state from the
   `status` in its own file.
5. At work start, except for an assigned read-only field review, classify the
   planning profile with the table below, or reuse an unchanged classification.
   For a complete supported profile, run the proposal inventory and read the
   relevant proposals (all for a full audit); an inventory error does not
   change the classification. At handoff, name every choice still open.
6. Set a Work Item to done through progress.md only after observing every
   Acceptance criterion and recording its result in Evidence. State what was
   checked and what was not.
7. An explicit stop, or a correction that invalidates running work, halts the execution it affects. Answer an informational question and continue. In
   a mixed message, separate the question from the instructions that add or
   change work, and append added work through authoring.md. Create no Work
   Item for maintaining Plan records.
8. Write each required fact once, in its field: actions in Steps, observations in
   Evidence, live conditions in Instructions. Keep a record's language unless
   the user asks for a change. A new Plan uses the language of the task
   request; its Work Items and Decisions use that Plan's language, whatever
   language later questions use. Field labels, IDs, statuses and technical
   literals stay unchanged.

## Helper invocations

Run the selector and validator commands here and in the references directly,
with complete UTF-8 output. Under an actual output limit, wrap them in the
capture call from output delivery; `--run` needs that real limit, not an
invented budget.

```text
python -X utf8 "<skill-directory>/scripts/check_text_size.py" --max-output-tokens <limit> --run -- python -X utf8 "<skill-directory>/scripts/<helper.py>" <arguments>
```

The selector's byte budget limits successful context only. A diagnostic is
always complete and means nothing was selected: read it whole. ID allocation:
every `--next-id` mode suggests the highest ID plus one and never reuses an
interior gap. It counts filename and metadata numbers, reports mismatches and
reserves nothing, so recheck ID and filename collisions directly before
creating the record.

## Proposal inventory

```text
python -X utf8 "<skill-directory>/scripts/select_context.py" --root "<project-root>" --proposals --format json
```

Read relevant Decisions from the returned paths. The inventory includes
unlinked proposals and works without an active Plan and without any Decision
yet. Open [Inventory details](references/read-only.md#surface-proposals) only
for output fields or selection-mode constraints.

## Load only the current route

| Operation | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Select, progress, block, complete or cancel Work Items; ordinary recovery | [progress.md](references/progress.md) |
| Insert, refine or order Work Items; author Step or execution annotations | [authoring.md](references/authoring.md) and progress.md |
| Judge Work Item or Step boundaries where they are not obvious | [planning-granularity.md](references/planning-granularity.md) |
| Read direction, list records, select dispatch units | [read-only.md](references/read-only.md) |
| Create or restructure, activate, finish, cancel or delete a Plan; change Goal | [native-project-lifecycle.md](references/native-project-lifecycle.md) and progress.md; authoring.md for Work Items |
| Create, audit or transition Decisions | [native-decision-format.md](references/native-decision-format.md) and progress.md |
| Explicit request to inspect or repair progress, migrate records, or maintain and clean up existing Plans (ordinary recovery uses progress.md) | [repair.md](references/repair.md) |
| Review assigned native fields without maintenance | read-only.md and the applicable field rules in progress.md or authoring.md; the Decision reference for Decision sections. Read the assigned sources only: no proposal inventory, maintenance, selectors, validators or tests. |
| Audit wording | authoring.md and progress.md; the Decision reference for Decision sections |
| Validate or diagnose structure | progress.md; an operation reference only if a diagnostic needs it |

If the planning profile is unknown, list the project root to locate
PROJECT_INDEX.md, docs/plans and docs/decisions. Index and docs/plans alone
are a complete profile without Decisions, since Git stores no empty directory.

| Observed profile | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Complete supported profile | Use the existing records and the operation's route. |
| Wholly absent; durable Plan requested | Initialize through the lifecycle route. |
| Wholly absent; no durable Plan requested | Leave it uninitialized. |
| Partial, foreign, unsupported or ambiguous | Preserve it; repair only an unambiguous format defect that changes no meaning, such as a Step numbered `01.`. |

Related Plan, Decision and index edits form one update. Validate the complete
profile once after the update is saved and before you report it or start
dependent work, not after each field write. An edit confined to an evidence
report that changes no profile fields, structure or referenced paths needs no
validation. progress.md has the command, the diagnostic handling and the
safe-write and continuation rules. Report outcome, active or blocked work,
what you actually observed, unresolved choices and the next action.
