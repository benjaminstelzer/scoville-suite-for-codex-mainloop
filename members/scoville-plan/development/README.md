# Development

Long tasks needed a durable answer to three questions: what is current, what
was decided and what is left? Explicit Steps and evidence made that state easier
to resume. The Viewer then had to show progress without repeating every detail
in its header. Planning helps when it makes the next action clear. A larger
record is not automatically a better one.

The [source](../scoville-plan/) and tests live in the suite. Install the built package.

From this member directory, run `python -B -m unittest discover -s development/tests`.

The independent [Plan Viewer](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan-viewer) owns application development, native builds and downloads. For Step-progress changes in `select_context.py`, run its `scripts/check_plan_compatibility.py` against the changed Plan package and the `development/tests/fixtures/valid-profile` fixture.
