# Scoville Plan

Scoville Plan keeps goals, decisions and progress in the repository so longer
work survives the next conversation. You can see what is done, what remains
and why a choice was made without reconstructing it from chat history.

Use it for work with dependencies or several sessions. Settle the requirements
and acceptance criteria before implementation, get independent advice where
useful, and revise the Plan when the facts change. A contained fix can stay small.

Scoville measures chili heat. Plan keeps the direction from being diluted by
one more perfectly reasonable detour.

[Plan Viewer](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan-viewer/releases/latest)
shows these records on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## How it works

- Use the repository's existing planning system and relevant Plan, Work Items and Decisions.
- Check current sources before starting the next item.
- Edit Markdown and YAML records with observed Step progress and any additional Instructions.
- Record concise acceptance results before completion and validate the records.

## What it enforces

- **Resumable work.** Goals, ordered Steps, dependencies and the current position
  stay explicit in the project's records.
- **Decisions with an owner.** Confirmed choices are recorded. Open questions
  remain proposals and block only the work that depends on them.
- **Evidence before completion.** Finished means acceptance was checked.
  Changes of direction preserve completed work, binding constraints and material decisions.

Edit records from one session at a time. Concurrent edits need reconciliation.

## What it costs

- Maintaining records takes tokens and time. It pays for continuity on dependent work. A small fix rarely needs a large Plan.

## How it was developed

Real project records shaped the resumable work units and progress checks.
The useful lesson was to keep decisions and accepted results close to the
work they explain, without turning routine updates into more work items.

## Compatibility

Requires Codex, repository read/write access and Python 3.11+ for the bundled helpers.
Targeted candidate-path tests in Codex with gpt-6.1-sol / low produced and
maintained valid native records, preserved open choices and non-repeatable
evidence, transferred remaining work with relevant regression guarantees,
honored an explicit opt-out, selected the initial todo item for a new profile
and retained draft/idle state when explicitly requested, while broader
lifecycle, implementation acceptance, other hosts and installed discovery remain
unverified.

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## Configuration

### Model choices for Workflow

Scoville Workflow for Codex Mainloop uses fixed main, review and explore model
and reasoning pairs. Setup shows or saves those project settings. An existing
Step execute annotation is retained and compared with the main pair. A conflict
requires a decision rather than dispatching that Step through a separate route.
Unsupported choices stop the affected operation without silently changing them.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Plan to create an implementation plan for migrating the billing schema, including dependencies and acceptance criteria.
```

```text
Create a detailed repository-owned implementation plan for the billing migration so workers can execute each point without this conversation.
```

State the result you want and the constraints that matter. Plan records the
work, dependencies and acceptance criteria. It does not dispatch agents. New Plans use
your task language; related records follow the Plan. An unrelated question does
not change an existing record's language.

### Progress and decisions

New Plan points use ordered Steps with explicit progress:

```text
1. [status: done] Write the draft.
2. [status: in_progress] Review it against the brief.
3. [status: todo] Deliver the reviewed text.
```

The agent records observed progress, keeps open decisions visible and asks
before dependent work. Older unmarked Steps remain valid, with unknown progress.
Completed Steps still need the Plan point's acceptance checks.

To correct an existing record, ask: "Review and correct PLAN-0001." The agent
checks the evidence and actual result before changing progress. Inspection
without a correction request stays read-only.

### Companion app

[Plan Viewer downloads](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan-viewer/releases/latest)
include a portable EXE and installers for Windows x64, DMGs and zipped apps for
macOS Apple Silicon and Intel, and a portable binary, AppImage, DEB and RPM for
Linux x64.

Open a project containing `PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `docs/plans` and `docs/decisions`.
The read-only Viewer shows current work, Step progress and decisions, refreshing
automatically while active. Removing a project from its list leaves the
repository untouched.

Portable copies keep the project list in `scoville-plan-viewer.xml` beside the
application. An installed copy in a read-only folder uses the platform's user
configuration directory. Skill and Viewer updates are independent; use a
Viewer that supports the progress fields in your Plan records.

The [authoring guide](scoville-plan/references/authoring.md) covers Step annotations,
field formats and helper commands. Plan uses `format_version: 1`.
