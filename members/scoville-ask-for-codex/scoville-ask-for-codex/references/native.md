# Native Ask agents

The calling Ask chat spawns selected Codex advisers directly with the
collaboration tools. Each adviser receives fresh context, its configured model
and effort, and a read-only assignment.

## Spawn and collect

Put the question, raw evidence and explicit limits in a UTF-8 file outside the
reviewed working tree, using the workspace temporary area or system temporary
directory. Exclude the caller’s verdict, unrelated history and other advisers’ answers. Build one
assignment per selected adviser:

```text
python "<ask-skill-directory>/scripts/build_adviser_prompt.py" --question-file "<question.txt>" --mode review --scope "<exact scope>" --reference "<consultation reference>" --workspace-root "<absolute-project-root>" --adviser-id <resolved-id> --format spawn --task-name <unique_name> --model <resolved-model> --effort <resolved-effort>
```

Use a unique task name with lowercase letters, digits and underscores, such as
`ask_sol_1`. Use `--mode consultation` for advice. Parse complete successful stdout as JSON
and pass it unchanged to `collaboration.spawn_agent`. The object supplies
`message`, `task_name`, `fork_turns="none"`, `model` and `reasoning_effort`.
A helper error or incomplete output stops dispatch. Correct its named input;
never repair the generated prompt. The host decides model/effort availability.

Retain adviser ID, requested settings, reference, scope and generated task name,
then the returned exact native handle and canonical task path. The host identifies the final's sender;
no startup callback is required. A handle is not a complete answer. Actual model
telemetry stays separate from requested settings.

Do not infer free capacity from an assumed limit or idle-agent count. Unknown
capacity permits an actual spawn attempt, not a claim that all advisers fit.
| Spawn result | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Capacity refusal | Retain the diagnostic and running advisers; mark undispatched ones pending. |
| Rejected spawn | Retain the failure. |
| Ambiguous result | Use `collaboration.list_agents` with the narrowest known canonical `path_prefix` that can resolve the retained task name and handle. Broaden only for that uncertainty; if unresolved, report the adviser unresolved with partial results. |

Never retry automatically or treat an unmatched agent as the requested adviser.
Do not wake completed advisers for cleanup, replace selected advisers, change
settings, create Codex chats or assume a `close_agent` tool exists.

## Collect and follow up

1. Use collaboration.wait_agent for bounded waits while advisers work. It waits
   for any mailbox update. Consume actual messages and final responses; the wait
   summary is not an answer.
2. Require the exact adviser's native final and completion. Match host sender
   to retained handle and answer to the latest question, adviser identity,
   reference and scope. Questions and substantive send_message are partial.
3. For complete-file delivery, read the entire file before
   accepting or using it. Metadata alone is insufficient.
4. Retain complete answers once; do not list advisers whose complete answers are
   retained. Missing or incomplete answers remain unresolved.
5. If only a label repeats, identify the answer from its retained assignment.
   A different reference or scope needs clarification. Never accept an earlier
   final as the answer to a later same-handle follow-up.

| Collection state | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Timeout | Only the wait ended. Continue collecting active advisers; keep completed answers and failures visible. |
| Missing or incomplete final | Retain exact pending handle; do not accept partial messages as the final. |
| Tool failure, user interruption or missing fact requiring the user | Collection may end with exact pending handles. |

Never count a question or failure as a completed review.

After a complete native final, retain the handle without routine acknowledgements,
closure messages or keepalives. It has ended its turn.
Retaining a handle does not keep the turn active or prove a host slot is free.
Necessary follow-ups use the targeted route below, not queued send_message.
If a necessary follow-up targets an agent whose state is unclear, check once with
`collaboration.list_agents`, `path_prefix` set to its retained canonical task
path. A completion race remains possible; add no polling loop.

For a necessary clarification or authorized follow-up, use
`collaboration.followup_task` with the retained agent ID or canonical task name.
It resumes an idle agent and also delivers to an active one. Clarifications
preserve reference and scope. A new follow-up question supplies a new reference
and explicit scope. Retain the intended message before sending; reconcile an
uncertain result instead of resending blindly. Keep each adviser independent.

Follow the entrypoint's follow-up settings policy; this tool cannot override
model or effort. Never replace an unavailable handle silently.
