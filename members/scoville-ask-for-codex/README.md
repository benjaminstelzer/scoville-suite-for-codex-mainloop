# Scoville Ask for Codex

Scoville Ask gets independent advice from the advisers you choose and returns
it to your current task. Use it for a patch review, a second opinion or a
comparison of approaches. Each adviser gets the question and relevant evidence
with fresh context.

Scoville measures chili heat. Ask adds a little heat to your assumptions.
Unanimous agreement is pleasant, but finding the missed problem is more useful.

## How it works

- Select configured advisers using native Codex agents or the Claude CLI.
- Give each the same question, scope and relevant evidence independently.
- Collect separate reviews or combine answers to a general question. Necessary
  clarifications use the same adviser; follow-ups after completion need a request.
- Show missing answers and failed starts alongside completed results.

Shared writing rules travel with the assignment. Detailed data, command and
delivery rules load when the task needs them. Claude follow-ups still include
the complete rule context.

## What it enforces

- **Independent advice.** Advisers assess the work. Changes remain with the
  calling task. Native read-only behavior is instructed, not sandbox-enforced.
- **Traceable answers.** Results stay attached to their adviser and question.
- **Explicit failures.** Unavailable models, invalid settings and failed calls
  are reported. Ask does not quietly choose a different adviser.

Claude uses Read, Grep and Glob. Web access requires an explicit
`claude.web_tools` setting or request override. Advisers do not run tests;
native agents may create temporary files only for necessary oversized answers.

## What it costs

- Each adviser adds model usage, waiting and agent capacity. Use extra opinions for decisions worth checking. You still have to weigh disagreements.

## How it was developed

Early consultations made collecting answers and asking follow-up questions
more complicated than the question warranted. Native adviser handles and
saved Claude sessions gave each conversation a clear continuation path.
Missing answers still have to remain visible: a partial panel is not a consensus.

### Current validation

Current native review and consultation cases used `gpt-6.1-sol / low`. Advisers
returned independent findings and respected the read-only scope. Local helper
tests also checked prompt delivery and Claude request/resume handling with a
CLI double. No current Claude provider behavior test was run.

These are targeted cases, not a general success rate or proof of faster model
execution. Encrypted native message records prevented an independent
byte-for-byte comparison of transmitted assignments.

## Compatibility

Requires Codex desktop online, Python 3.11+ and filesystem access. Native
advisers need collaboration agent tools. Claude consultations need a signed-in
Claude Code CLI, version 2.1.280 or newer for Opus 5.5.

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



### Set up Claude consultations

1. Install [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) if needed. Open a terminal or PowerShell window.
2. Run `claude --version`. Opus 5.5 needs **2.1.280 or newer**. For an older version, run `claude update`, then check again. Keep running Claude sessions open.
3. Run `claude auth login` and complete sign-in in your browser.
4. Run `claude auth status` to check that you are signed in.

## Configuration

The defaults are in `config.default.json` next to the installed `SKILL.md`.
Project choices go under `ask` in `.scoville/config.json` at the project
root. Anything missing falls back to the shipped defaults.
Reading settings creates no file. If you name something explicitly in a
request, it overrides these values for that call only, without saving them.

Use Scoville Setup to inspect or save adviser choices.

For example, this `.scoville/config.json` selects SOL and Fable by default and
changes only SOL's effort:

```json
{
  "ask": {
    "advisers": ["sol", "fable"],
    "presets": {"sol": {"effort": "medium"}}
  }
}
```

Project settings override the bundled defaults one field at a time, except
the adviser list, which replaces the default list completely. Native follow-ups
keep the same agent and settings. Changing model or effort requires a fresh
adviser. For a custom adviser, add an ID, route, exact model and effort to
`advisers`. The installed configuration reference covers helper
inputs and migration.

## Limitations

### Agent capacity

Codex retains native agent threads from earlier assignments, so longer
Workflow runs and Ask consultations can reach the host's agent limit.
To give these runs more room, raise the limit to 256 in
`~/.codex/config.toml` under `[agents]`. Add the section if it is missing:

```toml
[agents]
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 256
```

This is the suite's recommendation for longer runs. The
[Codex configuration reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference)
describes the setting. If a start or necessary message still fails, the
affected operation stops and reports the problem with its progress preserved
for continuation.

### Claude sessions

If Ask reports an expired OAuth session, run `claude auth login` again and
check the result with `claude auth status`. If an outdated CLI rejects a
supported model, run `claude update` and check `claude --version` before retrying.

## How to use

Ask naturally, for example:

```text
Use scoville-ask-for-codex to review this patch with SOL.
```

```text
Ask Fable and Claude independently how they would approach this problem, then return and compare their answers here.
```

Ask handles the consultation and necessary follow-ups without asking you to
approve each exchange. Request a follow-up when you need one. Native agents
keep their context, and Claude can resume its saved session.

To consult Claude, ask: **“Ask Claude to review this change.”**
