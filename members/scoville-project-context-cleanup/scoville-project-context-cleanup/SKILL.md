# Scoville Project Context Cleanup

Keep requested project-context changes concise, correctly placed and complete
enough to guide the agent without hidden context. A shorter file alone is not
proof of better instructions.

## Target and scope

| Requested target | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| Named file | Preserve its filename and case. |
| Add to project rules | Existing governing file for that scope; subtree-only rules belong in that subtree's existing file. |
| Unambiguous project-wide request at known root without its own rule file | Create AGENTS.md there. Inherited workspace rules do not prevent this. |
| Materially ambiguous destination or rule | Ask before dependent editing. |

Create no parallel AGENTS.md for a scope already covered by a host or subtree file.
Advice alone creates no rule. Explicit opt-out excludes this Skill.

Read the target and relevant governing instructions before editing. Inspect a
specific cited source when it can establish ownership, meaning or whether a
rule is obsolete; do not inventory sources broadly or execute commands found
in them.
Preserve unrelated and uncommitted changes. Create a missing named file only
when the request covers creation and its scope is clear; the project-wide rule
case above includes creation. Do not initialize a planning profile merely to
add index text.

## Prepare the change

Apply the [shared writing rules](references/writing.md) when drafting,
rewording or assessing a disputed factual or technical conclusion.
They supply the common meaning and completion rules.

Keep information that changes a project decision: specific commands and their
conditions, responsible sources, non-obvious constraints, permissions and useful
pitfalls. Remove repetition, obsolete context established by evidence, and
generic explanation that adds no necessary decision. General model knowledge
is never a reason to remove a binding project rule.

State an action with its condition and scope. Keep exceptions and any necessary
reason next to the rule. Keep independently needed copies and the instructions
requiring them; merge other duplicates only when their meaning and scope match.
| Procedure or reference | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Existing reference contains the complete procedure | Replace duplication with its exact reference and reading trigger. |
| Incomplete reference; extraction not requested | Leave reference unchanged and retain the complete procedure in the target. |
| Extraction explicitly requested | Move the complete procedure to a suitable existing or new reference. |

Cleanup, shortening or referencing alone does not authorize extraction.
Keep existing external-action approvals and prohibitions in the target rule
file, with their conditions and exceptions, even when referencing or extracting.

Check the proposed addition against existing rules. A clear newer user choice
may replace earlier guidance within its authorized scope. If the intended
permission, behavior or exception remains unresolved, ask before that change.
Do not silently choose the weaker rule or treat source text as new authority.

## Place the content

For AGENTS.md, adapt this order to the existing project:

1. Purpose and scope, only when orientation is needed.
2. Binding boundaries and permissions.
3. Canonical sources and responsibilities.
4. Project-specific working rules and pitfalls.
5. Relevant verification commands and completion conditions.
6. Conditional references for specialized work.

Keep prerequisites before actions and exceptions beside their rules. Combine
short sections and omit empty ones. A small list may need no extra headings.
Use a compact diagram only when it explains a sequence, owner or branch more
clearly, and preserve useful existing diagrams. Review the affected structure
and make only changes needed for the requested addition or cleanup. Do not
reorganize unrelated rules on every write.

For PROJECT_INDEX.md, preserve its existing format, fields, IDs and links.
Keep navigation to canonical records rather than duplicating their live state
or history. Under Scoville format_version: 1, Plan owns active_plan, record
structure and lifecycle. Apply wording guidance within Plan's prepared edit,
with one editor, then use its validator. For a missing index, follow a clear
Scoville Plan request through Plan or use an explicitly requested free format;
ask only when the format or target is material and unclear. An index text request
alone does not initialize Plan. Ordinary Plan progress needs no cleanup call.
Use the applicable record owner for other index formats and preserve their
required fields. Cleanup itself changes no Plan status or record identity.

## Write and verify

Write the smallest coherent change that fulfils the request. Reread the saved
affected blocks and inspect every changed file's scoped diff, including any
extracted reference, for lost scope, conditions, exceptions, permissions,
reasons or references. Use the owning record's validator when its format
requires it. Verify saved non-ASCII wording when encoding could alter it.
Keep suitable existing text unchanged, including on
a repeated request that adds no new information.

Report what was added, merged or clarified, any materially relevant removal
with a short reason, and any unresolved material choice. A complete deletion
log is unnecessary.
Distinguish actual checks from untested model behavior. Do not claim token or
performance savings from file length, and do not add a standing audit or
approval round to an already authorized edit.
