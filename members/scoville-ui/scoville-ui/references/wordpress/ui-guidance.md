# WordPress guidance additions

Read [common UI quality](../ui-quality.md) for information order, actions,
forms, states and accessibility. Apply these WordPress mappings within the same
scope. A local spacing audit does not activate unrelated concerns.

## Headings

Use exactly one primary page title. Heading levels follow content hierarchy, not
desired visual size.

Preserve the owning Core heading color, font size and font weight. For a
reported mismatch, inspect the computed values and winning CSS declarations
against an equivalent Core heading in the same WordPress version and runtime.
Compare page titles with page titles and section headings with section headings.
Do not flatten their differences or replace a native style merely because a
semantic token is available. Keep source findings separate from rendered proof.

## Navigation

- Put one small settings or tool page under Settings or Tools.
- Use a top-level menu only for a distinct, frequently used, multi-page product
  area. Provide consistent local navigation and expose the current item.
- Do not duplicate the Core admin menu with ornamental navigation.
- A page-title action is appropriate only when it is understandable before the
  main content. Form submission usually follows its fields.

Classic page header order:

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>...</h1>
  <hr class="wp-header-end">
  <!-- Core moves non-inline page notices here. -->
</div>
```

## Feedback

### Classic

- Use `add_settings_error()` and `settings_errors()` where applicable.
- Page Notices remain movable so Core places them after `.wp-header-end`.
- Field/component messages stay at their source and use `.inline` when Core
  notice styling is suitable. Do not use deprecated `.below-h2`.

### React

- Use `Notice` for persistent, important, actionable, error, warning, or
  page-level information.
- Use `Snackbar` only for low-priority short-lived confirmation when the result
  remains discoverable elsewhere.
- Expose asynchronous state programmatically without moving focus unless the
  interaction requires it.


## Components and accessibility

Use the owning WordPress group component or native fieldset with a legend. Preserve
Core or component contrast and focus behavior. A necessary custom color requires
measured WCAG AA evidence in the actual theme. Keep all visible and assistive
text translatable through [internationalization.md](internationalization.md).
