# Structured WordPress classification

Load only when structured classification was explicitly requested, after
[routing.md](routing.md). The router owns the semantic boundaries.

## Classification output

Return a structured object with all eight fields:

1. `surface`
2. `support_status`
3. `runtime_owner`
4. `shell_owner`
5. `spacing_owner`
6. `experimental_components_policy`
7. `evidence`: observed facts supporting the values.
8. `prohibited_recommendations`: every applicable stable identifier below.

Use the canonical values and precedence below. Examples do not establish ownership.
For ordinary findings, report only ownership facts needed to explain the
scoped result, not a full classification report.

Use this handoff matrix for the excluded version-1 surfaces. Combine its
required prohibitions with every applicable runtime rule below. For example,
a React SlotFill with an unknown package owner also requires the unknown-React
prohibitions. The surface row does not replace them.

| Excluded surface | Policy | Required prohibited identifiers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block Editor sidebar or SlotFill | `unknown` | `own-host-surface`, `frontend-theme-spacing`, `recommend-without-clarification` |
| Editor canvas | `unknown` | `own-host-surface`, `frontend-theme-spacing`, `recommend-without-clarification` |
| Post metabox | `deny` | `own-host-surface`, `inject-wpds-into-classic`, `global-wp-admin-overrides` |
| Dashboard widget | `deny` | `own-host-surface`, `inject-wpds-into-classic`, `global-wp-admin-overrides` |
| Profile field | `deny` | `own-host-surface`, `inject-wpds-into-classic`, `global-wp-admin-overrides`, `custom-css-before-core` |
| Existing Core list or screen | `deny` | `own-host-surface`, `inject-wpds-into-classic`, `global-wp-admin-overrides` |
| UI inside another plugin | `unknown` | `own-host-surface`, `assume-react-is-wpds`, `recommend-without-clarification` |

## Canonical structured values

| Classification condition | Required value or boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Request explicitly says no experimental policy was supplied | `experimental_components_policy: unknown`, even for Core Components or an otherwise deny route. |
| Excluded named Classic PHP host using Core, without that override | Policy `deny`; records host facts, grants no right to prescribe the surface. |
| Excluded React-owned or unspecified host runtime | Policy `unknown`; grants no right to prescribe the surface. |
| Page placement or host boundary not established by supplied facts | `shell_owner: unknown`; neither Hybrid nor runtime opt-in establishes a Core shell. |
| Page placement or another decision-relevant owner unresolved | `support_status: needs-clarification`; runtime opt-in does not resolve placement. |

Unknown policy still forbids introducing experimental APIs.

When a caller requests structured classification, emit these exact stable
values instead of prose variants:

| Field | Meaning | Canonical value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| surface | Plugin settings or tool | `plugin-settings-tool` |
| surface | Plugin workflow or dashboard | `plugin-workflow-dashboard` |
| surface | Plugin data view | `plugin-data-view` |
| surface | Explicit Network Admin | `plugin-network-admin` |
| surface | Block Editor sidebar or SlotFill | `block-editor-sidebar-slotfill` |
| surface | Editor canvas | `editor-canvas` |
| surface | Post metabox | `post-metabox` |
| surface | Dashboard widget | `dashboard-widget` |
| surface | Profile field | `profile-field` |
| surface | Extension of an existing Core screen | `core-screen-extension` |
| surface | UI inside another plugin | `foreign-plugin-surface` |
| surface | Plugin-owned page with unspecified category | `plugin-owned-unspecified` |
| surface | Admin surface with unspecified placement | `unknown-admin-surface` |
| support_status | Supported stable route | `supported` |
| support_status | Supported bundled experimental route | `supported-experimental-opt-in` |
| support_status | Supported Network Admin route | `supported-explicit-multisite` |
| support_status | Excluded host-owned route | `excluded-route-to-host-owner` |
| support_status | Missing decision-relevant fact | `needs-clarification` |
| runtime_owner | PHP with Core admin | `php-core` |
| runtime_owner | React with Core Components | `react-core-components` |
| runtime_owner | Bundled experimental WPDS | `bundled-wpds` |
| runtime_owner | Region-owned mixed page | `hybrid` |
| runtime_owner | Excluded host-owned runtime | `host-owned` |
| shell_owner | Core admin shell | `core-admin` |
| shell_owner | Core shell plus plugin root | `core-admin-plugin-root` |
| shell_owner | Core and React region map | `core-admin-region-map` |
| shell_owner | Network Admin shell | `network-admin` |
| shell_owner | Network Admin and React region map | `network-admin-region-map` |
| shell_owner | Block Editor shell | `block-editor` |
| shell_owner | Editor canvas shell | `editor-canvas` |
| shell_owner | Post editor shell | `post-editor` |
| shell_owner | Core Dashboard shell | `core-dashboard` |
| shell_owner | Core profile screen | `core-profile-screen` |
| shell_owner | Existing Core list or screen | `core-list-screen` |
| shell_owner | Host plugin shell | `foreign-plugin` |
| spacing_owner | Core default rhythm | `core-default-css` |
| spacing_owner | Core Components | `core-components` |
| spacing_owner | WPDS Stack and exported tokens | `wpds-stack-and-exported-token-stylesheet` |
| spacing_owner | Region-owned spacing | `region-map` |
| spacing_owner | Block Editor spacing | `block-editor` |
| spacing_owner | Editor canvas spacing | `editor-canvas` |
| spacing_owner | Post editor or metabox spacing | `post-editor-metabox` |
| spacing_owner | Core Dashboard widget spacing | `core-dashboard-widget` |
| spacing_owner | Core profile-screen spacing | `core-profile-screen` |
| spacing_owner | Existing Core list or screen spacing | `core-list-screen` |
| spacing_owner | Host plugin spacing | `foreign-plugin` |
| runtime_owner / shell_owner / spacing_owner | Unknown owner | `unknown` |

For structured `prohibited_recommendations`, use only the applicable stable
identifiers: `assume-react-is-wpds`, `custom-css-before-core`,
`define-wpds-tokens`, `frontend-theme-spacing`, `global-wp-admin-overrides`,
`inject-wpds-into-classic`, `own-host-surface`,
`recommend-without-clarification`, and `unlock-private-theme-provider`.
Their prose explanation may follow outside the structured object.

`inject-wpds-into-classic` prohibits introducing bundled experimental
components merely to restyle Classic UI, not a Core `wp-theme` stylesheet.
`define-wpds-tokens` prohibits plugin-authored token assignments or imitations,
not supported public provider props. `unlock-private-theme-provider` prohibits
private APIs on every version, not the public 7.1 export.

An unknown React runtime must include `assume-react-is-wpds`,
`define-wpds-tokens`, and `recommend-without-clarification`. An excluded host
surface must include `own-host-surface`; when the host facts needed for a
downstream recommendation are absent, also include
`recommend-without-clarification`. Additional applicable identifiers are
allowed, but these route-specific prohibitions must not be omitted.

A Classic PHP plugin page using Core must include `frontend-theme-spacing`,
`inject-wpds-into-classic`, `global-wp-admin-overrides`, and
`custom-css-before-core`. A bundled WPDS route must include
`unlock-private-theme-provider`, `define-wpds-tokens`,
`global-wp-admin-overrides`, and `custom-css-before-core`. A Block Editor
sidebar or SlotFill handoff must include `own-host-surface`,
`frontend-theme-spacing`, and `recommend-without-clarification` because this
Skill must stop before prescribing the host-owned details.
