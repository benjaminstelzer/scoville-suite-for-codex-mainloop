# Versioned Core tokens and public theming

Read this after routing. WordPress version, CSS token availability, and React
component ownership are independent facts. Do not migrate an existing Classic
page merely because a newer WordPress version offers tokens.

The missing relationship must be established from actual native markup and
component options before using the examples. Preserve source units and token
expressions. Resolved pixels in verification are evidence for a named state,
not replacement source declarations. See [classic-patterns.md](classic-patterns.md)
for native relationships and [wpds-tokens.md](wpds-tokens.md) for token facts.

## WordPress version and capabilities

| Target | Core token stylesheet | Public provider | Routing consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7.0 pinned baseline | No Core `wp-theme` style handle in the verified baseline | Not exported by pinned `@wordpress/theme` 0.7.1 | Preserve Classic pages and Core defaults. The explicitly opted-in bundled experimental path below remains version-specific. |
| 7.1 | Core registers `wp-theme` with semantic tokens for plugin UIs | Public `ThemeProvider` from `@wordpress/theme` through the Core script handle | PHP may consume Core tokens without React. React may use the public provider when needed. Neither requires experimental-component opt-in. |

Check the actual supported installation and minimum supported version. Style
and script registries are separate even though both use `wp-theme`. Registration
does not prove enqueue, successful loading, token availability, or rendering.
A spacing check on native
Core markup does not require a token-loading audit if it consumes no tokens.
Do not infer future 7.x contracts or package versions from either row.

```

Never bundle a second Core token copy, replace/deregister its handle or add an
unregistered dependency. Private API unlocking is forbidden
on all versions; pinned 7.0 has no public provider. An approved older-version
backport needs its own tested provenance/capability branch, not handle presence.
No provider or PHP-to-React conversion follows from token availability alone.

## PHP layout with a Core-token and older-version branch

This example adds a grid only for a new plugin-owned summary region that has
no native layout owner. It is not applied to `.wrap`, `.form-table`, or native
controls. The plugin main file defines this hook. Replace the example page hook
with the actual value returned by the menu registration API.

```php
function plugin_slug_enqueue_summary_layout( $hook_suffix ) {
    if ( 'settings_page_plugin-slug' !== $hook_suffix ) {
        return;
    }

    $wp_version      = wp_get_wp_version();
    $is_core_71      = 1 === preg_match( '/^7\.1(?:\.\d+)?$/', $wp_version );
    $has_core_tokens = $is_core_71
        && wp_style_is( 'wp-theme', 'registered' );
    $dependencies   = $has_core_tokens ? array( 'wp-theme' ) : array();

    wp_enqueue_style(
        'plugin-slug-summary-layout',
        plugins_url( 'assets/summary-layout.css', __FILE__ ),
        $dependencies,
        '1.0.0'
    );

    // Only stable 7.0/7.1 are covered here. Other minors and prereleases are
    // unverified; the numeric fallback is not evidence of version support.
    $gap = $has_core_tokens ? 'var(--wpds-dimension-gap-lg)' : '16px';
    wp_add_inline_style(
        'plugin-slug-summary-layout',
        '.plugin-slug-summary-grid { gap: ' . $gap . '; }'
    );
}
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'plugin_slug_enqueue_summary_layout' );
```

The plugin's `assets/summary-layout.css` contains only the missing layout:

```css
.plugin-slug-summary-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 18rem), 1fr));
}
```

On verified 7.1, the dependency causes Core's tokens to load before the plugin
layout. On the verified 7.0 baseline without that style registration, the
explicit `16px` Skill-Norm fallback expresses related summary groups. It does
not pretend to be a WordPress token and does not copy Core token definitions.
The example introduces no new plugin spacing variable or token namespace.

The stable WordPress minor-line gate and registration check select between already
verified compatibility paths. Registration alone is not a capability check:
the Gutenberg plugin or another plugin may register the same global handle on
an older Core release. An approved backport needs its own explicit, tested
capability branch with verified provenance and token names.
This example's verified matrix is stable 7.0.x and 7.1.x only. Prereleases and
other minor lines are excluded. A numeric branch on another version is not
evidence of support, and must not be accepted without revalidation.

The code cannot inspect CSS token contents. On 7.1 with an unexpectedly missing
handle, its numeric branch preserves layout but the installation fails token
acceptance and must be investigated. A registered handle with missing tokens,
a failed request, or an altered registration also fails validation, even if
the page still looks plausible. Do not hand-write a numeric fallback inside
the token reference. Generated fallbacks from official build tooling do not
change this source rule or remove the rendered token check.

Existing Classic pages with no missing relationship do not call this example
and do not acquire a migration requirement. Domain states should first reuse
native Notices. A genuinely custom state may use supported semantic token
pairs, but requires contrast and non-color status cues, not just token presence.

## React with the public 7.1 provider

This is a separate, optional React capability, not the PHP loading mechanism.
For a plugin-owned React region with an actual theming requirement, use the
public export from the target's supported package entry:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@wordpress/theme';

export function PluginThemeBoundary( { children } ) {
    return <ThemeProvider>{ children }</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

The 7.1 provider renders a wrapper `div` whose Core class uses
`display: contents`. It creates no independent layout box, but it does apply
the resolved corner-radius preset attribute even without color overrides and
does not accept wrapper customization props. Add only props verified as public
in `@wordpress/theme` 1.0.0, and only to satisfy an explicit requirement. Do not
use `isRoot` in a plugin subtree inside the Core document, unlock private APIs,
author `--wpds-*` assignments, or assume all props in moving package docs are
available in 7.1. Preserve the existing component owner.

| Target | Provider entry |
| --- | --- |
| Supported 7.1 package | Public `@wordpress/theme` export shown above. |
| Pinned 7.0 | Separately built no-provider entry; no public export assumed. |

A conditional JSX branch around a missing static export is not a compatible fallback.

1. Build against a package version compatible with the target.
2. With WordPress dependency extraction, verify `build/index.asset.php` includes
   the `wp-theme` script dependency and the entry bundles no second provider runtime.
3. Enqueue `wp-theme` as a **style** dependency too. Register the script with its
   generated dependencies and bind translations under [examples.md](examples.md).
4. Keep the CSS subpath out of the JS entry.

The provider does not replace the token stylesheet. CSS inheritance follows
the DOM, so check portals at their destination. Iframes and popup documents
need their own verified stylesheet loading. Avoid forwarding plugin theming
to the Core document or unrelated plugins.

## Verification and audit outcomes

| Case | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Existing Classic page, 7.0 or 7.1 | Preserve native elements and default CSS. No mandatory tokens, React, or component conversion. |
| PHP missing layout, 7.1 | `php-core`, Core `wp-theme` style dependency, required semantic tokens resolved, no duplicate token bundle. |
| PHP missing layout, older supported version without tokens | Native elements preserved, no unregistered dependency, explicit tested local layout fallback. |
| WordPress 7.0 with an unrelated or unapproved `wp-theme` registration | Ignore it for the Core 7.1 path and use the verified older-version fallback. |
| WordPress 7.1 with the Core handle unexpectedly missing | Preserve layout with the fallback, but fail token acceptance and investigate the installation. |
| Other minors (including 7.2), prereleases or unknown version | Unverified. The numeric fallback does not establish support or pass token acceptance; verify that version separately. |
| Registered but not loaded, or required token missing | Fail loading/token acceptance. Investigate the real document and registration, not runtime classification. |
| React 7.1 public provider | Public import and Core script dependency, Core stylesheet loaded, no private APIs, no second runtime. |
| React pinned 7.0 | No public provider assumed. Preserve the tested older entry without importing that export. |
| Experimental component policy is deny | Core token stylesheet and the public 7.1 provider remain allowed when needed. No experimental component opt-in inferred. |

In a rendered check, inspect the token and its consuming property separately:

```js
const style = getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('.plugin-slug-summary-grid'));
const token = style.getPropertyValue('--wpds-dimension-gap-lg').trim();
if (!token) throw new Error('Required Core gap token is missing');
if (style.gap !== '16px') throw new Error('Unexpected gap for the verified default density');
```

On every supported stable 7.1 installation where this example is used, require
the Core handle and run the token assertion regardless of which branch the
code selected. An unexpected numeric fallback must not pass token acceptance.
On the supported 7.0 fallback, assert the computed `gap` without requiring the
token. The `16px` expectation applies to the single density shipped by the 7.1
Core stylesheet. WordPress 7.1 and `@wordpress/theme` 1.0.0 expose no public
density switch. Do not transfer the compact or comfortable 7.0 package-table
values into this path. Check successful stylesheet loading and computed styles
on each supported release, then apply the affected cases in
[WordPress validation](validation.md#select-the-platform-checks).
