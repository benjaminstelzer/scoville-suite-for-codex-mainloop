# Scoville UI

Scoville UI builds and audits interfaces with the project's framework and
design system. It covers clear wording, useful hierarchy, responsive layouts
and accessible interactions, then checks the rendered result. A tidy component
tree is a start. People still have to use the page.

It includes specific guidance for plugin-owned WordPress admin pages, using
Core components and WordPress conventions.

Scoville measures chili heat. UI aims for a sharper interface without making
the user sweat.

## How it works

- Establish the user's task, approved design direction and framework components.
- Build the affected views, wording, states and responsive behavior.
- Inspect the rendered interface and try its relevant interactions.
- Apply the WordPress adapter to supported plugin-owned admin pages. Editor
  surfaces and metaboxes keep their host's conventions.

## What it enforces

- **A coherent interface.** Hierarchy, controls and terminology follow the task
  and the existing design system.
- **Usable states.** Loading, empty, error and success states receive the same
  attention as the convenient example with perfect data.
- **Access across devices.** Check responsive layout, zoom, reading order,
  contrast, focus and keyboard or touch operation where applicable.
- **Rendered proof.** Source checks alone cannot establish that the interface
  works. Unchecked rendering or interaction stays explicitly unverified.

See the [full instructions](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/blob/main/packages/scoville-ui/scoville-ui/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Rendered inspection and interaction checks take tokens and time. They catch problems the source alone cannot show. WordPress tasks also load platform guidance.

## How it was developed

General interface work and WordPress admin tasks shaped the shared checks.
Rendered inspection exposed problems that source review missed. Neither type
of check replaces usability testing with the people who will use the product.

## Compatibility

Requires Codex desktop, native agents, the complete suite and the project's
toolchain and browser or platform access for rendered checks, with Python 3.11+
and the bundled checker for size checks.
Targeted candidate-path tests in Codex with gpt-6.1-sol / low exercised a route
ownership correction, structured WordPress classification, localization-readiness
advice and review of supplied measurements and source complexity, while rendering,
interactions, accessibility conformance, translation loading, other hosts and
installed discovery remain unverified.

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## How to use

```text
Use Scoville UI to implement this settings screen with the existing component system. Cover its states and verify the rendered interactions.
```

```text
Audit the checkout interface for keyboard use, responsive behavior, accessibility and error recovery. Report findings without changing files.
```

### Checking the interface

Use the styling options the component supports. If custom CSS is needed,
explain why. Keep CSS values and the sizes actually rendered on screen apart.

Make related edits together, then check the code and the rendered result,
including spacing and alignment. If defects remain, collect the corrections
and recheck the affected behavior once that batch is done.

A consistency audit lists regions, variants and states, including content
below the fold. Each finding points to the source, measurements and visual
evidence, or explains what couldn't be checked. Look at alignment, text,
whitespace, the inside of controls, icons, wrapping and clipping, and say
which parts of the interface were checked.

The vendor guidance shaped the general rules, but platform-specific layouts,
measurements, control behavior and visual conventions aren't universal
requirements. The working rules are in the Skill itself. These sources show
where they come from, so routine UI changes don't need web research.
Rechecking the composition after elements change is how the Skill applies
these principles.
