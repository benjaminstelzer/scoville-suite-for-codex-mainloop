# Planning and Decisions

Use planning only when it helps coordinate real dependent outcomes, preserves
state across interruption, or records a material choice. Process is never a
substitute deliverable.

## Use one planning owner

An authoritative project plan is the sole durable planning state. A runtime that
requires its own plan holds a disposable mirror of the same work. Use a runtime
plan alone only when no project plan exists. Do not create a plan file, decision
log, validation ceremony, or second source of truth merely because a code task
exists.

Use the available planning mechanism only for multiple dependent work items,
material sequencing, or work that must survive handoff or compaction. For a
small contained change, implement and validate directly unless a binding project
workflow requires a tracked item.

## Define behavior-complete work

Keep one behavior-complete lifecycle item active at a time. Its outcome should
be independently resumable and observable. Implementation and its verification
for one observable behavior belong to the same behavior Work Item; test
commands, review, and documentation remain subordinate steps or evidence.

Split work only into independently resumable outcomes with distinct acceptance
boundaries. Separate dependencies, owners, or rollout timing justify a split
only when they create such independent outcomes. Keep acceptance and evidence
with the item that owns the behavior.

Define acceptance through distinct necessary outcome
conditions and required results. Keep implementation and test execution in
subordinate steps unless that method or check is itself required for acceptance.
Do not expand acceptance into a process checklist. For native
Scoville Plan records, Plan's field rules remain authoritative.

Continue to the next authorized in-scope item when its dependencies are met; do
not treat every checkpoint as a new task.

Keep records only for further development: the current result, remaining work,
binding constraints and material decisions. For native records, follow Plan's selected
progress/authoring/maintenance route for field ownership and review retention;
load no unrelated Plan route just for this reference.

## Record material decisions

For an assigned review of native Plan or Decision fields, use the bundled
Scoville Plan. Read its read-only route and applicable field
rules, not just Code's engineering criteria. Stay within the assigned source
boundary; this grants no maintenance, selectors, tests or record writes.

Use the criteria in SKILL.md's Resolve material choices section.

Record a material decision in the project's existing plan, ADR, decision log,
authorized commit, or pull-request mechanism. When none exists, preserve it in a
handoff only if future work depends on it. Do not invent a durable record system.
Retain the decision's source and status so a later agent can distinguish
authorization from an observed result.
Use `scoville-plan` for applicable canonical Plan, Work Item and Decision
mutation. In its `SKILL.md`, use **Load only the current route** to select the
operation's contract. Read its `references/planning-granularity.md` only when
Work Item or Step boundaries need judgment. Code retains engineering analysis
and the behavior boundaries above; Plan owns its native records.

## Resolve decision ambiguity

For ordinary details, choose the smallest reversible option that preserves the
outcome. For an unresolved material choice, follow the question rule in SKILL.md's Resolve material choices section.

Do independent work first, then ask one specific question before dependent work.
In unattended work, assumptions may resolve only harmless details or choices
inside an explicitly authorized decision space. If dependent work needs an
unresolved material choice, record the proposal and stop that dependent work;
continue only independent authorized work.

## Hand off and resume

Only when Scoville Handoff is active for an explicit transfer, use its
`SKILL.md` sections **Read within the transfer scope**, **Preserve continuation
facts** and **Compose and check the prompt**, with its
`assets/continuation-prompt.md`. They own source limits, required continuation
facts and the artifact. The summary below does not restrict that prompt.
This reference does not activate Handoff.

For existing project records, or a requested handoff when Scoville Handoff is
inactive, retain the requested outcome, binding constraints, current state,
decisive evidence, next concrete step, and any material decision not already
recorded canonically. This requires neither another Skill nor a new record
system.

On resume, treat the handoff as a snapshot rather than current truth: re-read
applicable instructions, inspect repository and plan state, and reconcile any
mismatch before continuing. Do not repeat completed work whose evidence still
matches the current tree.
