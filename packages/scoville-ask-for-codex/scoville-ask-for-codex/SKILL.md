name: scoville-ask-for-codex
description: Ask one or more configured advisers for independent advice or reviews from Codex, through fresh Codex subagents or Claude CLI. Use when the user requests an Ask consultation, a second opinion, or a review by specified advisers. Ordinary questions to the current assistant do not trigger a consultation.
compatibility: "Codex desktop online, Python 3.11+ and filesystem access. Native advisers require collaboration agent tools. Claude advisers require authenticated Claude Code CLI; Opus 5.5 requires CLI 2.1.280+."

# Scoville Ask for Codex

Collect independent answers in the calling task. A review asks each adviser to
assess the same evidence; a general consultation combines independent answers
into a synthesis. The caller owns any subsequent changes. Advisers keep the reviewed subject unchanged and never delegate the consultation.

When writing adviser framing, reporting results or assessing a disputed factual
or technical conclusion, read and apply the
[shared writing rules](references/writing.md). The helpers include those rules
for adviser answers while preserving the literal user question.
For composed adviser questions and follow-ups, apply
[agent instruction design](references/instruction-design.md).

## Choose the consultation

Infer `review` or `consultation` from the actual question; an explicit mode wins.
“Could this patch lose data?” is a review even without “for review”. If the
intended outcome is ambiguous, clarify before dispatch. Do not ask again when
the request already establishes the mode, advisers or permission.

Resolve settings with `scripts/ask.py`:

| Priority | Settings source |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Unsaved request overrides. |
| 2 | Selected project's `.scoville/config.json`, `ask` section. |
| 3 | [config.default.json](config.default.json). |

| Adviser selection | Presets |
| --- | --- |
| Explicitly named | Exactly those presets, even if absent from the default list. |
| None named | Default adviser list; it is not an allowlist. |

Select exactly the requested routes, models and efforts. Adviser IDs identify
results; display names are not agent handles. Resolve selected presets in one
call and report each adviser's settings. Read
[configuration and helper inputs](references/configuration.md) for resolution,
migration or the first helper invocation.

Reuse an already verified interpreter meeting this Skill's Python 3.11+
requirement. Otherwise check `py -3`
on Windows or `python3` elsewhere; try `python` if needed. Choose it locally,
without asking the user. Verify its version before the first helper operation.
Use that executable wherever examples say `python` or `<verified-python>`,
including Python commands after `--run --`.
Report a missing runtime only when no suitable installed interpreter is found.

Before processing machine reports or logs, use the [shared writing rules](references/writing.md).
If their complete text is not loaded, read it in a separate call before reading
the data. Reuse retained rules under their existing reload conditions.
Before helper calls, follow [shell command rules](references/shell-commands.md).

Native spawn_agent validates the requested model and effort on the actual host.
Report a host rejection without substituting another model or route.

An explicit Ask request commissions the full consultation: create the needed
adviser subagents, exchange necessary questions and answers, and return results.
Do not ask for separate agent or message approval or require authorization fields.
Respect explicit user limits and host requirements. Native Ask uses direct
collaboration tools in the calling chat.

## Ask and collect

Prepare a self-contained question, scope, requirements and raw evidence. Include
paths and working-tree scope when relevant. Exclude the caller's verdict,
intermediate reasoning, previous adviser answers, unrelated history and secrets
from fresh consultations. Read [native operation](references/native.md) or
[Claude operation](references/claude.md) for each selected route.

```

Dispatch only selected advisers, independently within host capacity and process
limits. Use fresh context and selected settings. Retain each adviser's handle,
settings, reference and scope, including running Claude process handles. Necessary
questions and follow-ups use the same adviser. A returned handle alone is not an
answer; keep partial answers and failures visible and do not silently replace advisers.

For a consultation, synthesize agreement, differences and useful conclusions
without inventing consensus. No mandatory second exchange round. For reviews,
distinguish findings from untested concerns and verify findings before authorized fixes.

In exchanges, apply [Evidence-based conclusions](references/writing.md#evidence-based-conclusions).
Present disputed claims and their evidence neutrally; do not frame a preferred
answer as fact or pressure advisers to agree. Neutral candidate acceptance or
objection questions are allowed. Ask advisers to substantiate disputed
conclusions and address contrary evidence. Check the reason for a changed
conclusion; an unexplained concession does not resolve a finding, and consensus
does not replace required review acceptance.

Retain requested and actually reported model/effort separately; unavailable
telemetry is unknown.

## Follow-up after completion

Retain the answer, evidence, exact native handle or Claude session ID and
settings. Resume only for an explicitly requested follow-up. Native follow-ups
keep the same settings. A requested change needs a fresh adviser: explain that
choice and obtain it unless already authorized. Claude follow-ups retain settings unless explicitly overridden.
Do not ask whether a completed review should stay open or close it when the user
changes topic.
Claude print-mode exits after its answer; a retained ID is saved history,
not a running agent. Follow the original route and never select the most recent
session implicitly.

All Skills included in this suite must be installed and enabled. Use the
applicable owner without checking sibling availability. Load only instructions
needed for the task. Explicit invocation gates and user exclusions still apply.

Native advisers may inspect the subject but must not change it or run tests.
Only necessary oversized-answer delivery permits temporary files in `.scoville/temp`,
as specified in [native delivery](references/native-delivery.md).
Spawning a native agent adds no technical write barrier or separate sandbox. Claude tool restrictions
and opt-in web access are described in references/claude.md.

## Runtime helpers

Use the bundled helpers for their operations. Read their invocation instructions,
not their source, unless diagnosing a failure.

| Condition | Required route |
| --- | --- |
| Python and every named helper are available | Use the bundled helper. |
| Missing Python, script, dependency or helper error | Stop the affected operation; do not substitute manual execution. |

Helpers: `scripts/ask.py`, `scripts/build_adviser_prompt.py`, `scripts/check_text_size.py`.
