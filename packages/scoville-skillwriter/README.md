# Scoville Skillwriter

Scoville Skillwriter writes and reviews Skills and reusable prompts for current
frontier models. It keeps the goal, real constraints and useful context while
cutting repetition and unnecessary ceremony.

Scoville measures chili heat. Skillwriter keeps instructions sharp without
seasoning every sentence with another warning.

## How it works

It combines shared instruction-design rules with an authoring workflow. Approved
revisions preserve the exact pre-edit state for comparison; reviews return
findings without editing. The host's Skill Creator owns Skill structure,
packaging and format validation. Source review and format validation are
reported separately from observed model behavior.

## What it enforces

It preserves the intended outcome, activation boundaries, permissions and
acceptance criteria. It asks only about material changes beyond the request or
prior approval. Changed instructions and affected consumers are checked together
in the existing source review.

## What it costs

The Skill has no paid service calls. Host model usage and any explicitly requested evaluation have their usual costs.

## How it was developed

Skillwriter grew from maintaining Skills and reusable prompts in real projects.
Repeated rules and explanations made instructions longer without necessarily
making them clearer. Shared writing guidance became the basis for both
standalone Skills and the Suite.

Revisions combine focused tests with analysis of how agents use the instructions
in real workflows. The results guide what to clarify, remove or keep. The next
revision is tested and used again.

## Compatibility

Requires an Agent Skills host with filesystem access and its Skill Creator for
Skill authoring: OpenAI's in Codex or Anthropic's in Claude Code. Standalone
prompts need no Skill Creator. No runtime scripts or network access are required.

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## How to use

Ask to write, simplify or review a Skill or reusable prompt, or invoke `$scoville-skillwriter`. For a revision, it respects already approved changes and asks only for changes outside that approval.

## Sources

See the [full instructions](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex-mainloop/blob/main/packages/scoville-skillwriter/scoville-skillwriter/SKILL.md) and their sources-and-evaluation
reference for the authoring guidance and the distinction between source review,
format validation and observed model behavior. The Skill is also available as
[Scoville Skillwriter](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-skillwriter)
outside the suite.
